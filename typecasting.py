# need to tell the value
a=int("2")  # a=int("rk") this is not applicable for the type casting bcz we need suitable data

b=10.5

print(sum)

#here we take a 2 as a string but need to tell this in integer format
#we can not add string or float value it gives the error
#so we manually convert this 2 is string but in integer format
