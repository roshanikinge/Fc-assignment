#while Loop
#q1
# while True:   when condition is true then print infinite times
#     print("hello") if u want to stop this means u want to create false condition at specific
#     level then use variable and also add their increment ether decrement also
#q2
count=1 #here we take a variable  to stop the loop at specific point but here
# we take a  s
# tarting value  1
while count<=5:  #here we give the condition where to loop will stop
    print("hello") #print what u want
    count+=1 #here the condition is increment one by one
#we can also calculate the count value by using this
print(count) #this count also print where to hello is print
#q3
i=1

    print("rk" ,i)

i=1
while i<=4:
    print(i,i) #here 1st i is for number that i want to print 1 to 4 number
    # and 2nd i is for count  that count how many number is print
    i+=1
#q5
i=5
while i>=1:
    print(i,i)
    i-=1 #here we take the one for print 5 to one here i think decrement the value
